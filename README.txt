Welcome to the Powder Wizzard!  This is an ongoing project that will explore the how we can incorporate machine learning into the avalanche forecasting process!  I will be updating the code as I clean it up and learn more about efficent Machine Learning methods.  I would also like to provide credit to the Open Avalanche Project where it is due since I have begun this project using the weather and historical avalanche forecast data that was already available through that project's github account.  Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions and all contributitons are welcome!  I'd love to put together of snow loving hackers that are inspired to mountain travel in remote regions safer.

The trainList.ipynb notebook can be used to input data from the revised data file.

The transfer.ipynb notebook file was used to combine variables from NWAC forecasts with those in NAM weather models.
