Welcome to the Powder Wizzard!  This is a project for Professor Ryan Kastner's 
CSE 237D at UC San Diego.  For the next few weeks, I'll be playing with past
avalanche and weather data to see if I can redesign the avalanche forecasting 
GUI to make backcountry skiing both easier and safer!  Don't hesitate to reach
out if you have any questions.
